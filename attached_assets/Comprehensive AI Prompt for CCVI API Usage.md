# Comprehensive AI Prompt for CCVI API Usage

## API Overview

The Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) API, developed by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), provides access to extensive survey data related to climate change vulnerability in Pakistan. This API serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and organizations working on climate resilience, water management, and sustainable development in the region.

The API is hosted at `https://pakwmis.iwmi.org/iwmi-ccvi/backend/docs` and follows RESTful principles with a well-organized structure of endpoints categorized by data domains. All endpoints use the GET HTTP method and return data in JSON format, making it straightforward to integrate with various applications and analysis workflows.

## Core Data Domains

The CCVI API encompasses several interconnected data domains that collectively provide a comprehensive picture of climate vulnerability across different regions of Pakistan:

### Geographical Hierarchy

The API implements a hierarchical geographical structure that allows for precise spatial filtering of data. This hierarchy flows from provinces (the largest administrative units) down to districts and further to tehsils (sub-districts). This structure enables users to analyze climate vulnerability at different spatial scales, from broad regional patterns to localized community-level insights.

### Temporal Coverage

The API provides access to data across multiple survey years, allowing for temporal analysis of how climate vulnerability and related factors have changed over time. The `/api/location/years` endpoint serves as the entry point for understanding the temporal scope of available data.

### Household and Population Demographics

The API offers rich demographic data at both household and individual levels. This includes household composition, socioeconomic status, age distribution, and other key demographic indicators that influence climate vulnerability. These data points are essential for understanding the human dimension of climate change impacts.

### Climate and Environmental Parameters

The API provides access to climate statistics and environmental parameters that characterize the physical aspects of climate vulnerability. This includes data on climate conditions, environmental resources, and other biophysical factors that affect community resilience.

### Vulnerability Indices

At the core of the API is the Climate Change Vulnerability Index framework, which breaks down vulnerability into three key components:
1. Exposure (the degree to which communities face climate hazards)
2. Sensitivity (how susceptible communities are to climate impacts)
3. Adaptive Capacity (the ability of communities to respond and adapt)

These components are combined to calculate overall vulnerability scores, providing a nuanced understanding of climate risks across different regions.

## Endpoint Structure and Usage

### Location Endpoints

The location endpoints serve as foundational reference data for filtering other API queries:

```
GET /api/location/years
```
This endpoint retrieves all available survey years in the dataset. The temporal data serves as a crucial filter for all other endpoints, allowing users to analyze trends over time or focus on specific survey periods. When developing applications that require historical analysis or time-series visualization, this endpoint should be queried first to establish the temporal boundaries of available data.

```
GET /api/location/provinces
```
This endpoint provides a comprehensive list of all provinces covered in the survey data. As the highest level in the geographical hierarchy, provinces serve as primary spatial filters for narrowing down data queries. The response includes province names and identifiers that can be used in subsequent queries to other endpoints.

```
GET /api/location/districts
```
This endpoint returns district-level information, which can be optionally filtered by province. Districts represent the second tier in the geographical hierarchy and provide a more granular spatial resolution for data analysis. The response includes district names, identifiers, and their parent province relationships.

```
GET /api/location/tehsils
```
This endpoint offers tehsil-level data, which can be filtered by both province and district parameters. Tehsils (sub-districts) represent the most detailed administrative unit in the standard geographical hierarchy used in the API. This level of detail is particularly valuable for localized vulnerability assessments and targeted intervention planning.

```
GET /api/location/area-types
```
This endpoint provides classification of areas (such as urban/rural distinctions or other categorizations) that can be used as an additional dimension for filtering data. Area classifications add another layer of analytical capability, allowing users to compare climate vulnerability across different settlement types within the same administrative units.

### Household and Population Endpoints

These endpoints provide access to demographic and socioeconomic data:

```
GET /api/household/summary
```
This endpoint delivers aggregated household information that can be filtered by location parameters (year, province, district, tehsil, and area classification). The summary data provides a high-level overview of household characteristics in specified areas, serving as an entry point for more detailed household analysis.

```
GET /api/household/statistics
```
This endpoint returns detailed household statistics suitable for generating charts and in-depth analysis. It accepts a comprehensive set of location filters (year, province, district, tehsil, and area classification), allowing for highly specific data queries. The statistics may include household size, income levels, access to services, and other socioeconomic indicators relevant to climate vulnerability.

```
GET /api/population/summary
```
This endpoint offers aggregated population statistics that can be filtered by location parameters. The summary provides an overview of population characteristics in specified areas, which is essential for understanding the demographic context of climate vulnerability.

```
GET /api/population/age-distribution
```
This endpoint returns age distribution data for the population, which can be filtered by location parameters. Age distribution is a critical factor in climate vulnerability assessment, as different age groups have varying levels of sensitivity to climate impacts and different adaptive capacities.

### Climate Endpoints

These endpoints focus on climate and environmental data:

```
GET /api/climate/climate/statistics
```
This endpoint provides climate statistics that can be filtered by location parameters. The data likely includes temperature patterns, precipitation levels, extreme weather event frequencies, and other climate metrics that characterize the physical exposure dimension of vulnerability.

```
GET /api/climate/environmental/parameters
```
This endpoint returns environmental parameters data, which can be filtered by location. This may include information about natural resources, land use patterns, water availability, soil quality, or other environmental conditions that affect community vulnerability and adaptive capacity.

### CCVI (Climate Change Vulnerability Index) Endpoints

These endpoints provide access to the components and calculations of the Climate Change Vulnerability Index:

```
GET /api/ccvi/adaptive-capacity
```
This endpoint returns data on adaptive capacity, which measures the ability of communities to adapt to climate change impacts. Adaptive capacity is influenced by factors such as access to resources, infrastructure, education, institutional support, and diversification of livelihoods. The endpoint accepts location filters to focus on specific geographical areas.

```
GET /api/ccvi/exposure
```
This endpoint provides exposure data, which quantifies the degree to which communities are exposed to climate hazards such as floods, droughts, heat waves, or sea-level rise. Exposure is primarily determined by geographical location and climate conditions. The endpoint accepts location filters for targeted analysis.

```
GET /api/ccvi/sensitivity-index
```
This endpoint returns sensitivity index data, which measures how susceptible communities are to harm from climate impacts. Sensitivity is influenced by factors such as dependence on climate-sensitive livelihoods, health status, and access to basic services. The endpoint accepts location filters to focus on specific areas.

```
GET /api/ccvi/vulnerability
```
This endpoint provides the overall vulnerability index, which combines exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to give a comprehensive measure of climate change vulnerability. This holistic index helps identify the most vulnerable communities and regions, prioritize interventions, and track changes in vulnerability over time. The endpoint accepts location filters for targeted analysis.

### Administrative Units Endpoints

These endpoints provide access to administrative unit data and hierarchical relationships:

```
GET /api/administrative-units/{unit_type}
```
This endpoint returns administrative units of the specified type. The `unit_type` parameter accepts values like "province", "district", or "tehsil", allowing flexible queries for different levels of the administrative hierarchy.

```
GET /api/administrative-units/{unit_type}/{parent_id}
```
This endpoint returns child administrative units under a specified parent unit. For example, it can retrieve all districts within a specific province, or all tehsils within a specific district. This endpoint is particularly useful for building hierarchical selection interfaces in applications.

```
GET /api/administrative-units/lookup/{unit_type}/{name}
```
This endpoint allows looking up administrative units by name, facilitating searches for specific geographical areas. This is valuable for user interfaces that need to support search functionality or name-based queries.

### Utility Endpoints

These endpoints provide basic API functionality:

```
GET /
```
The root endpoint likely returns basic API information or redirects to documentation.

```
GET /health
```
This health check endpoint verifies that the API is operational, which is useful for monitoring and ensuring service availability.

## Query Parameter Patterns

Most endpoints in the CCVI API follow a consistent parameter pattern, accepting the following filters:

- `year`: Temporal filter that can be provided as a single value or an array of years
- `province`: Geographical filter for provinces, can be provided as a single value or an array
- `district`: Geographical filter for districts, can be provided as a single value or an array
- `tehsil`: Geographical filter for tehsils, can be provided as a single value or an array
- `area_classification`: Categorical filter for area types, can be provided as a single value or an array

These parameters are typically optional and can be combined to create highly specific queries. When multiple values are provided for a single parameter (using array format), the API returns data matching any of the specified values (OR logic). When multiple different parameters are provided, the API applies AND logic between parameters.

## Best Practices for API Integration

### Hierarchical Data Fetching

When building applications that use this API, implement a hierarchical data fetching approach that mirrors the geographical structure of the data. Start by fetching available years, then provinces, then districts, and so on. This approach ensures that users can make meaningful selections at each level of the hierarchy.

### Caching Strategy

Consider implementing a caching strategy for reference data such as years, provinces, districts, and tehsils, as this information changes infrequently. Caching these responses can significantly improve application performance and reduce unnecessary API calls.

### Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for API requests, particularly for cases where:
- Location filters might not return any data
- Network connectivity issues might interrupt requests
- The API might return unexpected data formats or error responses

### Data Visualization Considerations

When visualizing data from this API:
- Use choropleth maps to represent vulnerability indices across geographical areas
- Implement time-series visualizations to show changes in vulnerability over time
- Create comparative visualizations to highlight differences between regions or area types
- Consider multi-dimensional visualizations that can represent the three components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) simultaneously

## Example API Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Regional Vulnerability Assessment

A researcher wants to assess climate change vulnerability across all districts in Punjab province for the most recent survey year:

1. Fetch available years to identify the most recent survey year
2. Fetch the list of districts in Punjab province
3. For each district, fetch the overall vulnerability index
4. Visualize the results on a choropleth map of Punjab

### Scenario 2: Temporal Analysis of Adaptive Capacity

A policy analyst wants to track changes in adaptive capacity over time for a specific district:

1. Fetch all available survey years
2. For each year, fetch the adaptive capacity data for the target district
3. Create a time-series visualization showing how adaptive capacity has changed
4. Analyze factors contributing to changes in adaptive capacity

### Scenario 3: Comparative Analysis of Urban vs. Rural Vulnerability

A development organization wants to compare climate vulnerability between urban and rural areas across multiple provinces:

1. Fetch the list of provinces
2. For each province, fetch vulnerability data filtered by urban and rural area classifications
3. Create comparative visualizations highlighting differences in vulnerability components
4. Identify patterns in urban-rural vulnerability disparities across different regions

## API Authentication and Rate Limiting

The documentation does not explicitly mention authentication requirements or rate limiting policies. However, when integrating with the API, be prepared to:

1. Implement authentication if required (look for authentication endpoints or documentation)
2. Respect any rate limits that may be in place
3. Implement appropriate retry mechanisms and backoff strategies for failed requests

## Conclusion

The CCVI API provides a comprehensive data resource for understanding climate change vulnerability in Pakistan. By leveraging its well-structured endpoints and consistent parameter patterns, developers and researchers can build powerful applications and conduct in-depth analyses to support climate resilience efforts. The hierarchical organization of geographical data, combined with the multidimensional vulnerability framework, enables nuanced insights into climate risks and adaptive capacities across different regions and communities.
